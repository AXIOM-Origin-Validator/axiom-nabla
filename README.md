# axiom-nabla

AXIOM Nabla — citizen wallet-state verification mesh (gossip, TARDIS heartbeat, bloom eras).

Part of the AXIOM protocol family — specifications live in
[axiom-docs](https://github.com/AXIOM-Origin-Validator/axiom-docs), research in
[axiom-papers](https://github.com/AXIOM-Origin-Validator/axiom-papers), binaries in
[axiom-dist](https://github.com/AXIOM-Origin-Validator/axiom-dist).

> **Evaluating AXIOM?** Start with the
> [Technical Review Guide](https://github.com/AXIOM-Origin-Validator/axiom-docs/blob/master/REVIEW_GUIDE.md)
> — it maps each of the protocol's principal claims to its specification,
> implementation, tests, and known limitations, with a falsification exercise
> per claim. The project's own case against itself is in
> [axiom-core](https://github.com/AXIOM-Origin-Validator/axiom-core): `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` and
> `THREAT_MODEL.md`.

## Contents

`nabla/` (mesh node) · `nabla-ceremony/` (root-key ceremony tooling).

## Protocol pin

This repo builds standalone: its protocol dependencies are git-pinned to
[axiom-core](https://github.com/AXIOM-Origin-Validator/axiom-core) tag `core-d1e5cb67`
(and [axiom-lib](https://github.com/AXIOM-Origin-Validator/axiom-lib) tag `lib-v3.7.1`).
Upgrading the pin is a deliberate act — the protocol evolves slowly by design.

## Releases

This repository receives one snapshot commit per AXIOM release, exported from
the project's working tree (3.7.1 at export). Its git log is the release
history. License: GPL-3.0.
