# axiom-nabla

AXIOM Nabla — citizen wallet-state verification mesh (gossip, TARDIS heartbeat, bloom eras).

Part of the AXIOM protocol family — specifications live in
[axiom-docs](https://github.com/AXIOM-Origin-Validator/axiom-docs), research in
[axiom-papers](https://github.com/AXIOM-Origin-Validator/axiom-papers), binaries in
[axiom-dist](https://github.com/AXIOM-Origin-Validator/axiom-dist).

## Contents

`nabla/` (mesh node) · `nabla-ceremony/` (root-key ceremony tooling).

## Protocol pin

This repo builds standalone: its protocol dependencies are git-pinned to
[axiom-core](https://github.com/AXIOM-Origin-Validator/axiom-core) tag `core-b77fd28a`
(and [axiom-lib](https://github.com/AXIOM-Origin-Validator/axiom-lib) tag `lib-v3.3.0`).
Upgrading the pin is a deliberate act — the protocol evolves slowly by design.

## Releases

This repository receives one snapshot commit per AXIOM release, exported from
the project's working tree (3.3.0 at export). Its git log is the release
history. License: GPL-3.0.
